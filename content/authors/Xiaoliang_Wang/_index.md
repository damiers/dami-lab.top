Hi, I am Xiaoliang Wang. I was introduced to the field of computational neuroscience as an undergrad majoring in biology and have fallen in love with it since. I am particularly interested in understanding neural computations with models. I am also excited about developing neural-inspired systems and deep learning. Right now I am working on a computer vision project to develop a workflow to group animal behaviors into meaningful clusters in an unsupervised manner.
