Xiaoli joined our team as a research assistant in 2021.
Xiaoli has a great passion for brain science, thus she returned to academia after a few years of working experience in the industry. During her days in the DAMI lab, Xiaoli was developing novel algorithms to accurately register neurons in long term recordings of calcium imaging data.

We wish Xiaoli the best in her future endeavors.
