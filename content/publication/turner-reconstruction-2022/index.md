abstract: We assembled a semi-automated reconstruction of L2/3 mouse primary visual
  cortex from ∼250 × 140 × 90 μm3 of electron microscopic images, including pyramidal
  and non-pyramidal neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and precursors,
  pericytes, vasculature, nuclei, mitochondria, and synapses. Visual responses of
  a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are publicly available, along
  with tools for programmatic and three-dimensional interactive access. Brief vignettes
  illustrate the breadth of potential applications relating structure to function
  in cortical circuits and neuronal cell biology. Mitochondria and synapse organization
  are characterized as a function of path length from the soma. Pyramidal connectivity
  motif frequencies are predicted accurately using a configuration model of random
  graphs. Pyramidal cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger
  and more reliable visual responses. Sample code shows data access and analysis.
